There are 4 Milestones in this project:

## Milestone 1: 
Load pre-processed Open Street Map (OSM) data containing cities' geographic features into appropriate data structures. Write helper functions to set up the StreetMapLibrary

## Milestone 2:
Create a Graphical User Interface using GTK. Display all geographic elements of the map and incorporate additional features with OSM data  (Suwbay lines, Point of Interest Filters, etc.)

## Milestone 3:
Implement A* algorithm to support path-finding feature to the map. Add corresponding UI elements.

## Milestone 4:
Attempt to solve the Travelling Courier Problem: find a sub-optimal path for picking-up and dropping off multiple delivery packages throughout the city.
